| UI Framework | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Material-UI v5 | ✅ Enhanced |
| Charts | Recharts | Recharts + MUI X-Charts | ✅ Enhanced |
| State Management | React Query + Auth Context | Redux Toolkit | ✅ Enhanced |
| Dashboard Tabs | 7 tabs (diet, appointments, etc.) | 6 optimized tabs | ✅ Streamlined |
| Admin Panel | 5 tabs with full CRUD | 5 tabs with analytics | ✅ Equivalent |
| Authentication | JWT + role-based | JWT + Redux auth | ✅ Enhanced |
| Responsive Design | Mobile-first Tailwind | Mobile-first MUI | ✅ Equivalent |

## Key Improvements Over Archive
1. **Design System**: More cohesive Material-UI design vs mixed components
2. **Performance**: Next.js 15 with optimized bundle splitting
